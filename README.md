# javatechie_devops_integration
This is MongoDB template and repository learning project.

But I am also trying to learn DEVOPS.
We will be integrating Intellij to Github -> CI
and Jenkins will run the build when I push the cide to Github, then Jenkins will also create a docker image of the application
and push/store it to the Docker Hub or Registry.

The whole thing will be automated through Jenkins
